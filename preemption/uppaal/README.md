# UPPAAL models of a safety critical protocol

This directory contains UPPAAL 4.X models for a safety critical protocol inspired
from the model introduced in Section 3 in:
*Thomas BÃ¸gholm, Henrik Kragh-Hansen, Petur Olsen, Bent Thomsen, Kim Guldstrand Larsen:
Model-based schedulability analysis of safety critical hard real-time Java programs.
JTRES 2008: 106-114*

- `scheduler_no_share.sh` is a timed automaton model of a safety critical protocol
inspired from the one introduced in the article above.
Run `scheduler_no_share.sh` for help on how to build a UPPAAL model from the script.
